# 🛡️ Drakkar Fitness

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Drakkar Fitness** — a performance-first fitness platform forged for those who lead their own path.

We’re building a precision-focused ecosystem that redefines how athletes, trainers, and everyday warriors train, connect, and progress. Everything is designed to move with intent — no fluff, no wasted motion.

## 🔐 Private Repositories

While we build and refine the core experience, all repositories are private.

### Internal Projects:
- `DrakkarFitness-Android` — Native Kotlin (Jetpack Compose)

Architecture is modular, secure, and built for scale.
